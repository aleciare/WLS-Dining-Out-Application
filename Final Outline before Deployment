1.	PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Existing tracking apps, such as Baritastic and MyFitnessPal, despite their broad features, do not offer the specialized functionality needed by bariatric patients to navigate the unique challenges of restaurant dining. 
•	Large portion sizes: Smaller portion sizes are often required after bariatric surgery. Overeating can cause significant pain.
•	Menu navigation: Navigating restaurant menus and packaged foods for wholesome meals is a challenge, as many products mask unhealthy fats, excess sugars, and refined carbs.
•	Social anxiety: Social meals can cause anxiety for patients, who may feel pushed to eat past their feeling of fullness.
•	Fluid management: WLS patients dining out need to plan around the need to avoid drinking liquids with their meal. 
•	Nutrient prioritization: Standard menus are inadequate for WLS patients, who must prioritize protein and other dense nutrients to meet their essential dietary needs.
2. PROBLEM ADDRESSING: Specifically designed for WLS patients, this intuitive platform simplifies the entire dining-out process, from making reservations to the moment they finish their meal.
•	Pre-planning: Plan your meal with confidence by searching for restaurants and filtering menu items by specific bariatric guidelines.
•	Menu intelligence: This software performs a nutritional assessment of restaurant menus, spotlighting high-protein options while detecting dishes that may be considered unsafe or unhealthy.
•	Guided experience: Users can track their meals and pace for better portion control.
•	Actionable strategies: "The app empowers you to make informed dining choices with practical strategies like sharing entrees and special requests.
•	Community support: The app's integrated social network is designed to enhance social connectedness by providing users with a forum for sharing tips and narratives, which addresses issues of anxiety and isolation.
3. PLATFORM: We will be developing a native application for Google's Android operating systems, with distribution planned through the respective app marketplaces.
